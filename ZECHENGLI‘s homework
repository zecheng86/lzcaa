```

First of all: change the YAML header and put **your name** as the
`author`!

## Introduction

Under the `data` folder there are two data files, `data9b_m.txt` and
`data9b_w.txt`. Each row in both files contains for one person (women in
`data9b_w.txt`, men in `data9b_m.txt`) the number of steps that this
person took on a particular day (`steps`) and the body mass index
(`bmi`). Assume that both traits are normally distributed for males and
for females. Your task is to perform analyzes to compare steps and BMI
between women and men.

0.  Start by loading both datasets in two different data frames. Make
    sure to check if the **header** was correctly specified!

**Answer:**

```{r q0}
#dw <- read.table(...) # for women's data
#dm <- read.table(...) # for men's data

dw <- read.table("data/data9b_w.txt", header = TRUE)
dm <- read.table("data/data9b_m.txt", header = TRUE)
```

## Analysis

Consider the following (alternative, not null) hypotheses:

1.  The correlation coefficient between `steps` and `bmi` is negative
    for women.
2.  The correlation coefficient between `steps` and `bmi` is positive
    for men.
3.  There is a difference in the mean number of steps between women and
    men.

Think about which test to use and calculate the corresponding p-value.

**Answer:**

```{r q1}
# negative correlation between steps and bmi for women?
# It is negative correlation between steps and bmi for women.
correlation <- cor.test(dw$bmi, dw$steps)
correlation
```

**Answer:**

```{r q2}
# positive correlation between steps and bmi for men?
# It is NOT positive correlation between steps and bmi for men.
correlation <- cor.test(dm$bmi, dm$steps)
correlation
```

**Answer:**

```{r q3}
# difference in the mean number of steps between women and men?
diff_w_m <- mean(dw$steps) - mean(dm$steps)
```

4.  What other conclusions can you draw from the data?

**Answer:**

```{r q4}
# other conclusions?
plot(dw$steps, dw$bmi, xlab = "Number of Steps for Women", ylab = "Number of bmi for Women")
plot(dm$steps, dm$bmi, xlab = "Number of Steps for Men", ylab = "Number of bmi for Men")
```
